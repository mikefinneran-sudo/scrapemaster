## ScrapeMaster Integration Script

Let me create a script to enrich Sales Nav exports:

```python
# linkedin_enricher.py

import asyncio
import csv
from pathlib import Path
from core.engine import ScraperEngine, ScrapeOptions
from core.validator import RealDataValidator

async def enrich_from_linkedin_export(input_csv: str, output_csv: str):
    """
    Enrich LinkedIn Sales Nav export with website data

    Input CSV columns (from Sales Nav):
    - company_name
    - industry
    - location
    - employees
    - linkedin_url
    - website (if available)

    Output: Enriched with phone, services, certifications
    """

    engine = ScraperEngine()

        linkedin_data = list(reader)

    print(f"üîç Enriching {len(linkedin_data)} companies from LinkedIn...")

    for i, company in enumerate(linkedin_data, 1):
